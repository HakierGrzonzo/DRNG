# DRNG - Loadout randomiser for DRG
## Description
 DRNG is an application designed for Deep Rock Galactic players that want to spice up their experience by randomising the loadout they deploy in the game.
 Every single piece of equipment is randomised - the weapons, gadgets, armor, pickaxe and perks. Even the class can be randomised.

## How to run
 .exe file is available in the releases tab and is the only file needed to run the application. Windows will most likely flag the file and block it. You can either allow the file or download the source code and create the app using for example `pyinstaller`.
